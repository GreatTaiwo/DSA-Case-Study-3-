# DSA-Case-Study-3-

This is a project from Digital Skillup Africa (DSA) Data Analysis Class with the Incubator Hub. The training focused on Microsoft Excel, SQL and Power BI. This particular repository is for the Capstone Project titled Case study 3, a Power BI project.  

## Project Topic: Case Study 3: Palmora Group HR Analysis

### Project Overview

This project aims to analyse the company data and generate insights that the Palmoria management team would need to address, with focus on gender-related issues within the organization and its regions. The following are the analysis tasks:
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay
employees a minimum of $90,000
- Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:
● How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000,
etc.?
● Also visualize this by regions

## Data Sources

The primary source of the data used were Palmoria Group emp-data, an XLS Worksheet and Palmoria Group Bonus Rules, a Microsoft Excel Worksheet. 

## Tools Used
Microsoft Power BI for Data transformation and analysis [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/downloads) or install directly from Microsoft store, which is strongly adviced.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
1. There are two genders in the organization. However, some employees refused to disclose their gender and N/A was applied as a generic gender status to these employees.
2. Some employees were taken out from the dataset because they were without a salary because they were no longer with the company.
3. Lastly, some departments were taken out because they indicated as “NULL”.
All these reduced the dataset from over a thousand (+1000) rows, to eight hundred and ninety nine (899).
